# About this Blog

This blog does not have a specific area of focus. It is a flexible website where I share my research about anything in the world, but it is almost always connected to Data Science.

Through the use of data analysis, the articles are intended to shed light upon existing or new issues. It is always my dream to discover a brand-new problem and share with the world.

This is called a "Lab" because I want to put anything I experiment with. It has to be fun!

## How it was Made

I forked a GitHub repository named "Dactl," made by melangue. The website runs on the Jekyll machine. I used the Atom Editor to change the UI of the blog, and customize for my needs. I go to Atom everyday to tinker with code and add articles. This blog is currently hosted by GitHub pages.

"Dactl" is under MIT License, so I can freely customize it. However, I would like thank melangue for providing an amazing theme to start with! 

If you are interested in learning how to create a customized blog for yourself, I can definitely help you!

# About Me

Welcome to my blog, and my name is Sangwook Cheon. I am a 11th grade student at Jakarta Intercultural School.

I started my blog because I love writing, and looking into issues of the world.

Many people start a blog, and then abandons it because it is hard to make journaling into a habit. It is my goal in high school to regularly develop this blog, along with my knowledge and skills.
