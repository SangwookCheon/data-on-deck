        <title>What is the Human Genome Project?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the first thing scientists did to tackle the rapidly-evolving COVID-19? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They decoded the virus. It is often known as “genomic sequencing.” After China shared the first cases with the world in late December, scientists gathered to identify the full sequence of the coronavirus. Researchers from France, Korea, and other nations followed suit soon after. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!–-break-–&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genomic sequencing works as a foundational blueprint for scientists. The sequence is used as a reference when developing diagnostic tests and determining potential treatments. 
While the genomic sequence for COVID-19 quickly became a shared resource of the globe, such a process was more complicated a few decades ago, when the United States kickstarted an ambitious plan to decode a person. Yes, the “human” genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worthwhile to revisit the history behind the project that pushed us into the grand “era of the genome.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following major technological advances in the 1970s, the notion of decoding a human got more feasible for scientists. Some critics assumed that functions of genes cannot be ever studied through their sequence, but a combination of potential scientific merit and public interest pushed the idea forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Department of Energy (DOE) and National Institute of Health (NIH) launched the “Human Genome Project” on October 1st, 1990, with the rough completion year of 2005. At the time, they did not expect that they will finish two entire years in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../post-images/D5ADBFBF-BB29-46B9-88A5-FA70A80FE9A1 1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their big aim was to determine all genes and sequence nucleotides of the human genome, and also create databases to store information. But another important aspect was considering the philosophical and ethical issues, so roughly five percent of the budget was allocated towards this cause. Philosopher Eric T. Juengst was the director of this program. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of sequencing the genome right away, the team built genetic and physical “maps” first. In essence, DNA clones were replicated for sequencing, and polymorphic markers were used to target specific “chromosomal regions.” Then, they tested genomic sequencing on smaller organisms before moving to the more complex human genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The task of sequencing the human genome stretched outside the US, where France and the United Kingdom funded their own research institutes. The Sanger Centre of the UK opened in 1993, which received support from the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council. Japan and China also jumped in soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, the team noticed a growing interest from the private sector in genome sequencing, such as the Celera Genomics. It proposed a distinctive way of sequencing, called the “whole-genome shotgun method,” which breaks the entire genome with high-frequency sound waves into many smaller pieces of DNA, sequence them, and reassemble the sequences with supercomputers by mapping the clones to chromosomes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public sector and Celera used different approaches, but they achieved the same result: sequencing roughly 3.2 billion base pairs. The US President Bill Clinton, DOE, and other scientists announced that the project has been completed in 2000, but the results actually had many gaps. Three years later, despite less public interest due to war and terrorism, the project officially came to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sequencing of the genome was truly an international effort. Six countries contributed 16 centers in total. Along the process, efficient methods of sequencing entire genomes were created and tested. Scientists were able to give partial credit to the initial assumption because the structure of the genome could provide limited insights into its function. Still, the project opened a new window of opportunities for the broad field of biology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is curious to see if the Human Genome Project has provided equal opportunities for all parts of the world. How has the project accelerated medicine development, and is there any aspect that is left behind? If the publicity of the genomic sequence spurred innovation, what are the policies of the beneficiaries of the modern world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into these questions, I will write about the role of the sub-group that worked on the philosophical and ethical implications of the project. I hope to look at the visions they created and how they compare with the current society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Research Paper Used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gannett, Lisa, “The Human Genome Project”, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2019 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paradox of Computers for People in Need</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;“I have a little announcement,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a regular lunch meeting for my
service club. I pulled out my MacBook,
walked to the podium—an English
classroom is our venue—and began
talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am happy you had fun in AlHurriyah! If you couldn’t go, we all can
revisit the school sometime. Sixty fifthgraders greeted us, and we checked if
there is a vacant room for computers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!–-break-–&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sixty?” Some gasped in unison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Exactly. We can teach more than
sixty, or even the whole school.
Sugata Mitra’s ‘Hole in the Wall’
experiment proved the power of a
single computer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But I want to share another story.
Last week, there was a three-hour trip
to a hilly village in Sentul. One girl I
met is re-reading her old comic books
because school is too far away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our advisor raised his eyebrows. I
took a breath and continued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Here’s the dilemma: five computers
for ten out-of-school children in the
village or five-hundred students in AlHurriyah. What’s better?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Managing computers located threehours away would be hard, though.”
one member commented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Definitely. But here’s a plan called
‘Computer Drive.’ Like a delivery
service…” I spoke for another ten
minutes, but I knew I lost the
audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dilemma, in fact, left me clueless
for days. After researching and
thinking, I passionately supported the
school-less children. Although it didn’t
pass, it was a profound battle between
many and few, far and near, and
ultimately, my values and experiences
of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this dilemma ever answerable?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Adding Latitude and Longitude given a location using Geocoder library</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;about-geocoder&quot;&gt;About Geocoder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;Geocoder&lt;/a&gt; is a python library that enables us to get Latitude and Longitude value given an address anywhere in the world. I will work with the cleaned dataset I created with Beautiful soup from this &lt;a href=&quot;https://sangwookcheon.github.io/2019/07/12/web-scraping-using-beautiful-soup/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;. I will add Latitude and Longitude coordinates to each Postal Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that Geocoder library can sometimes be inconsistent, returning ‘None’ instead of coordinates. This library is free-of-charge, but you might want to use a more stable but paid service like &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start&quot;&gt;Google Geocoding API&lt;/a&gt;. For this task, using Geocoder library is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!–-break-–&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s import Geocoder library and other tools:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/SangwookCheon/dd89e8d990f12f57405e4564915d7209.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the first 10 rows of my cleaned table. In total, there are 103 rows, meaning that there are 103 unique postal codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first need to initialize lat-long coordinates to be an empty list, which will be filled for each postal code and added to the table. We also need to get postal codes from the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stored the clean data table as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; by using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;read_csv&lt;/code&gt; function of Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/SangwookCheon/7b452c32af64bd176e26ac140b99f4e4.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is the part where I loop until coordinates are derived from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;geocoder.google&lt;/code&gt; function, and then add it to the original table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/SangwookCheon/749be59c9d2cfe279494ab29e198e144.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this might take some time, because there is loading time when getting coordinates. When finished, now there is an updated table with two new columns, named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;latitude&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;longitude&lt;/code&gt;, as shown below:
&lt;img src=&quot;/in-post-images/Screen Shot 2019-07-13 at 11.45.23.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;recap&quot;&gt;Recap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geocoder library can be used to get latitude and longitude values using a street address. This library is free-of-charge, but can sometimes be inconsistent in yielding results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting coordinates is important in many applications, such as putting marks on trending places on a map and clustering places based on their latitude and longitude values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SangwookCheon/non-e-stop-python-data-science/blob/master/Machine-Learning/Example%20Projects/IBM%20Capstone%20Project/add_latlon.ipynb&quot;&gt;link to Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt; for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also learn about Foursquare API, a map-related API with many social features, by referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SangwookCheon/non-e-stop-python-data-science/blob/master/Machine-Learning/Example%20Projects/IBM%20Capstone%20Project/foursquare_api_exploration.ipynb&quot;&gt;this notebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Everything related to maintaining this Blog - Nuts and Bolts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not an article. I am simply building a catalog of notes that are useful when updating this blog. Because the entire code has to be altered, it is useful to include some technical details. I forget details too often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Updated: June 6th, 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;!–-break-–&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The length of the article must be quite long for the tags to be clickable, on the blog page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-build-the-site&quot;&gt;How to Build the Site&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building the site with jekyll is done everytime I want to see the changes I made to the blog.
Every time I open the project, I must first export the ‘gems’ that are located in my local machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, run
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;export GEM_HOME=~/.gem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, run
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;export PATH=$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is personal to my local machine, so it must be different for other users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, build/update the website by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;. Then, the ‘_sites’ folder must be updated, and it is ready to be uploaded to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-put-a-break-to-an-article&quot;&gt;How to put a break to an Article&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Include &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--break--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to create a break in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-create-a-tag&quot;&gt;How to Create a Tag&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple process. I used to create a separate ‘permalink’ for each and every tag, but for this blog, I just need to create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_my_tags&lt;/code&gt; folder, create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; file with the name of the tag.
Then, inside the file, input the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/SangwookCheon/c56017d6abc92980193b3f4e479fc941.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-syntax&quot;&gt;Code Syntax&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, there’s a problem with Code Syntax. The UI crashes when published to GitHub, while it works locally. So, I need to create a better version or use an external tool for code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until this is fixed, let’s just use GitHub gists. They are a little bit tedious to create, but they work really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;problems-i-need-to-fix&quot;&gt;Problems I need to Fix&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On a mobile phone, the title of an article is too big when I click on the link to that page. I must make the font size adapt to screen size&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to make a search function that instnatly shows results, like the TeXT theme.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need to enable pagination for the “creatives” tab. Currently, it’s not working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
