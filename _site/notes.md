This Markdown will be used to document everything I need to remember when developing this website.

# When writing Articles
* I must include <!–-break-–> to make sure the excerpt is short when displayed on the homepage.

# Layout of the Homepage
* Go to _includes/blog.html to change how I display the title of each article on the homoepage. I want to put a black box around the title.
* Currently, a big challenge is to fix the code excerpt bug showing up on posts, but don't let it bug me when I am trying to write articles.
