     <p>A big part of this blog will be reading research papers and sharing what I learned, including a brief summary along with key insights. I believe that reading papers is the surefire way to stay updated on the latest developments and gain valuable knowledge. They have value that goes beyond simply studying textbooks.
<p>In this current world where I am not allowed to go out, research papers are the best way to keep learning. From data science to biology to artificial intelligence, the catalog of research papers is constantly evolving, and I can’t wait to dive into the exciting field.
<p>I watched an incredibly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHTOI0KtZnU">helpful video by Siraj Raval</a>, who is passionate about the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more. I am putting a summary of what he suggested in the video, which I hope will be useful to others as well. All the credit for the following information goes to Siraj’s video, so please check it out.
<p>Here we go!
<!--break-->
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>
<p>Siraj reads anything between 10 to 20 research papers a week! But he doesn’t have any graduate degree, so this is the result of purely getting better over time.
<p>The Collective University is the Internet. Remember this.
<h1 id="what-resources-can-i-use">What Resources Can I Use?</h1>
<p>Siraj finds the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">Machine Learning SubReddit </a>most useful when it comes to discovering relevant and refreshing research papers.
<p>Also, he often uses <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">ArXiv Sanity</a>, which is a more user-friendly version of the traditional <a href="https://arxiv.org/">ArXiv.org</a> made by the Cornell University. Both of these contain millions of advanced papers, so they should be used in conjunction. I can filter the results based on what interests me.
<p>Another website is a blog made by an Australian machine learning engineer, who puts blog posts that are very descriptive and hands-on. It’s called <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-research-a-machine-learning-algorithm/">Machine Learning Mastery</a>, and this website is my favourite. The good thing about this is that he emphasizes practicality over complicatedness, so if you follow his article, you will easily be able to make an implementation yourself. Research papers can sometimes be daunting or difficult to try out by yourself. He also sells amazing books that teaches you with easy explanations (I have them and they are outstanding), but most of the content can be found within the blog. I recommend using this website to gain confidence in machine learning (which I need) by learning the concepts fast and building your own models to solidify knowledge. Once the foundation is set, it would be much easier to read more advanced research papers.
<p>DIY is also important!
<h1 id="how-do-i-choose-what-research-papers-to-read">How do I choose what Research Papers to Read?</h1>
<p>Set a small goal each week - what do I want to learn more about?  Is it activation models? Hyper-parameter tuning? Siraj can go through difficult papers much better if he has a motivation and a real reason to dive into it.
<h1 id="how-do-i-actually-read-the-paper-is-there-a-specific-method">How do I “Actually” Read the Paper? Is There a Specific Method?</h1>
<p>Yes! Siraj calls it the <em>3-pass Method</em>.
<p><strong>First Step:</strong> Just skim through the paper. Read the title and see if it is interesting. Read the abstract. If it is still intriguing, the skim through the entire paper. Read headings and subheadings, but ignore the math entirely. Read the conclusion as well as references, to see if there are any research papers that you already read. Only attempt to get a overarching view on what the paper intends to do.
<p>It is important to see if the paper is “worth your time.” You can even look at Reddit to see the initial reactions of people who already read it.
<p><strong>Second Step:</strong> Re-Read, more critically, taking notes as well (summary!). Read all the English text, and get a high-level understanding of the math. If you cannot understand anything, it might be a sign that you need a little bit more foundation. But never give up! There must be some articles online made by some other people that explain the concepts more easily.
<p>Very Important: When I read about the experiment, consider if the results are repeatable, backed up with good evidence. Hopefully, there is some relevant code along with the paper that I can use by myself, most likely available on GitHub. Read the code and try to run the code locally to replicate the results.
<p><strong>Third Step:</strong> Siraj has a Jupyter Notebook full of notes and images that help explain concepts. He says that teaching is the best way to retain information, which I agree, so I will write blog posts about every research paper I read! I hope you will do the same.
<p>The third step is all about breaking down the math further. Understand every part of the math, using Wikipedia to understand any ambiguous concepts. If Siraj is “really ambitious,” he also tries to “replicate the paper programmatically, using hyper parameters settings and equations that it describes,” but I honestly do not understand what he means.
<hr />
<p>But I hope the major points are laid out nicely in this article. Thank you for tuning in, and I will come back with an interesting research article soon.
