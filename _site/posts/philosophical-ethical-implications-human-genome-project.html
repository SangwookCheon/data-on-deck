<p><strong>The Research Paper Summarized:</strong>
<p>Gannett, Lisa, “The Human Genome Project”, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2019 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).
<p>This is a rather long article, but the research article is gargantuan in size. It was full of technical and scientific terms, but it has a lot of worthwhile thoughts.
<hr />
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Like the Internet itself, the genomic sequence of the human is available to everyone. The long sequence of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs are printed on a website like the zeros and ones we see when we search for images of “hackers.”
<!--break-->
<p>After the grand Human Genome Project (HGP) was completed in 2003, scientists have been trying to decode the sequence. It was upheld as a landing-on-the-moon-scale accomplishment, with a promise of grand breakthroughs in medicine and biology.
<p>However, scientists have not yet “hacked” the sequence. Although it is there for exploration, the understanding of human function is still in its infant stage.
<p>As the efficient study of genome in general is especially important in the era of unpredictable epidemics—switching from “reactive” to “preventive” mode of medicine as outlined by Leroy Hood—philosophical and ethical implications should be brought into discussion.
<p>Interestingly, the “ethical” issues in drug development take a significant part of the process. What kind of topics are considered? Is there a foundational understanding of what the HGP entails? This research paper provides “a synopsis regarding what questions have been asked, what range of responses has been offered, and what remains for philosophical attention and debate.”
<h1 id="understanding-hgp-conceptually">Understanding HGP Conceptually</h1>
<p>The concept of the human genome brought excitement to many scientists. The HGP was expected to bring transformational results, even to the point of discovering the “human essence” with strong ties to religious thoughts. James Watson, the initial Head of the HGP, spoke with excitement that the “basic philosophical questions about human nature” can potentially be answered with the knowledge.
<p>These collective imaginations of what HGP will bring are called “genetic reductionism,” the belief that we are merely the result of pieces of DNA coming together. Some Christians blended the idea by explaining that there is nothing wrong with discovering the “instruction book” that God created, but others warned that we will view ourselves as “raw material,” worth no more than the nature itself.
<p>Walter Gilbert, one of the prominent molecular biologists, envisioned a simple compare-and-tell system, where we can find the stretches of DNA that make us “uniquely human.” For examples, we can compare our genomic sequence to that of a mouse to spot differences. However, its simplistic nature soon got challenged: entire populations of species must be studied to even notice any difference.
<p>Gilbert also suggested that genes are the ultimate recipe book that explains all “cellular or organismal properties” of any species. The concept of genes perhaps approached him as a point of ‘singularity’—commonly understood as the birth of general computer intelligence that surpasses human capacities—that promises never-ending discovery of human nature and societal development. However, the paper points out that this view is the dangerous path to “technological fixes at the genome” and even “parental desire” to manipulate children through genetic screening and gene modification.
<p>The concept of genetic reductionism is once again developed when Gilbert predicted that “genes are sufficient cause of behavior,” as a result of predicting the protein structure from the genomic sequence. Reductionism moves onto Determinism. These pre-study expectations often seem come up in modern conversations, where “genes” are casually referred to explain appearances, personalities, behaviours, and even human origin. It is important to note that genetic reductionism is limited in effect. Because the word “gene” has aways been a scientifically ambiguous term with “great plasticity,” it is not surprising that philosophical debates often spring up.
<p>When genes seemed to gridlock humans with the assumption that we are “pre-determined,” they are met with another powerful theory of human nature.
<h2 id="nature-vs-nurture-controversy">Nature vs. Nurture Controversy</h2>
<p>Although we still consider DNA as “fundamental,” as the paper calls it, scientists noticed that the HGP actually proved useful in challenging genetic determinism.
<p>The paper makes a very interesting point: “While virtually all biologists disavow genetic determinism today, it is not always so clear what exactly they are denying.” It is because genes do explain some characteristics, at least partially.
<p>DNA is considered a priority over other cellular components in terms of causal relationships. Given that all other components are unchanged, notifying the DNA sequence may result in a “predictable and specifiable change” in protein sequence. But some believe that all components are “potential bearers of information,” so this topic is controversial at large.
<p>Now, the question of external effects come into play. Does the society affect who we are? It was the assumption of Watson that “children come into the world with fixed personalities.” There were attempts to quantify the relative contribution of genes and environments, but the paper argues that it is “misleading” because causal relations cannot be derived from the “analysis of variance,” with the two variables quite incompatible with each other.
<p>Genes may cause “tendencies” or “predispositions,” we simply cannot say that they are the cause of voluntary behaviours. The HGP is not a definitive answer to the Nature vs. Nurture problem.
<h2 id="geneticization">“Geneticization”</h2>
<p>The attempt to reduce humans to genes is only a part of the picture: the modern society constantly tries to form genetic explanations for both common and rare diseases. This phenomenon is called “Geneticization.” Although this may sound promising, it once again faces the effects of the environment.
<p>Now, scientists label something a “genetic diseases” only if genes are “both necessary and sufficient” causes regardless of the environment. Diseases like diabetes or cancer require the study of environmental factors, such as smoking and high-glucose diet.
<p>The trend of attaching the popular “genetic” tag is the direct result of advancements in genetic sequencing and the belief that understanding diseases at the genomic level <em>guarantees</em> a more targeted approach in drug development. Although we are enjoying the advent of personalized and efficient medicine, the narrow focus on genes can leave out environmental factors.
<p>The HGP seems to have added a powerful tool that can go hand-in-hand with more traditional approaches to diseases and humans at large.
<h1 id="ethical-thoughts-on-the-hgp">Ethical Thoughts on the HGP</h1>
<p>After all, the purpose of HGP was to benefit the humanity equally. The study of ethics ensures fair and equitable use of this technology, and this was the job of the ELSI (Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications) subgroup.
<h2 id="patenting">Patenting</h2>
<p>The first issue of focus is patenting. Patents are designed to encourage scientists to avoid hiding their findings by providing legal rights. The race to patent newly-discovered genomic sequences, however, caused problems.
<p>When genomic sequence is patented, other institutions developing medicines or diagnostic tests based on it have to pay the fee, increasing the financial burden to patients. Especially when the government funds research projects, “the public ends up paying twice” as “consumers” and “taxpayers.”
<p>The US has the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) that incentivises the development of medicine for rare diseases, which suffer innovation due to uncompetitive market. Allowing pharmaceutical companies to patent genomic sequence or treatments drives up the cost. For patients with rare diseases, many of whom do not have a sustainable source of living, patenting is no more than prioritizing profit over lives.
<h2 id="genetic-testing">Genetic Testing</h2>
<p>This is another hot topic that came into spotlight after the HGP encouraged scientists to develop faster and more efficient genetic tests. They can be done for diagnostic, predictive, and reproductive purposes, but the third one is most thought-provoking.
<p>During carrier screening, parents discover the risks of passing genetic diseases onto their children. For further testing, a cell of embryo is analysed and blood tests are done as well. There are both economic and ethical thoughts on this.
<p>There are arguments that screening for potential gene-related diseases of embryos allow parents to prepare preventive medicine for their children, without having to abruptly “react” to undiscovered diseases later on that cause an immense financial burden. However, will parents simply choose to drop births because of the shortly-arriving blast of burden? What if there are errors in genetic testing?
<p>Also, getting more knowledge does not always translate to better ethical decisions or happiness. Parents may “feel guilty” for passing on diseases or having to withdraw births. When children discover their destiny told by their genes, they might easily develop mental disorders. Financial burden may be taken off parents’ shoulders, but neither parents nor children may avoid emotional burden.
<p>Reproductive rights of the 21st Century is much more than the “right to bear or have a child.” Now that children can be screened and chosen before birth, we should consider whether technological enhancements are acceptable.
<p>At one end of the spectrum, there is the infamous “eugenics”: systematic screening, sterilisations, categorisation, and ultimately, segregation of ‘inferior’ people. Many warn that promoting technological interference in child bearing is dangerous, such as Diane Paul, an influential historian. Some also worry that the “society’s acceptance of diversity” will narrow down. It is understandable—the pursuit of a ‘better’ and ‘healthier’ child may prompt parents to seek the popular definition of those terms.
<p>Interestingly, the paper points out that we already moved past so-called “negative” eugenics, which is looking for possibly harmful traits in babies. It discovered a plethora of Internet websites that promote “positive” traits like certain eye color, height, talent, and even SAT scores. There is no doubt that some parents will demand such features, creating a competitive market.
<p>Leaving behind the myriad arguments on what is right based on ethics, we should remember that children with pre-disposed diseases or disabilities are not guaranteed to live a painful and worthless life. To me, the decision to bear or drop the child based on genetic testing involves too much guesswork: with the baby unable to join in the discussion, parents predict how a child will live based on the seemingly objective analysis report. This surely must be the biggest decision in their lives.
<h2 id="genetic-discrimination-and-justice">Genetic Discrimination and Justice</h2>
<p>Our brain is plastic, hands can be trained, and personality changes. But we cannot change our genes, and therefore, we should never be discriminated against what we are born with. Sadly, the modern “gene” world presents many dangerous possibilities.
<p>Men or women with genetic conditions may fear looking for partners because they can require the sharing of information for the sake of future children. People born with supposedly “weaker” genomic profile may have disadvantages in workplace and insurance. If proper privacy policies do not exist, people may be discriminated, having to share their most private piece of information.
<p>For insurance companies, they can label genetic susceptibility as a “preexisting condition.” Countries with no universal health care, like the US, are of bigger concern. Government-funded insurance, with no interest in maximal profits, is the only surefire method to cover everyone regardless of genetic profile.
<p>Other industries are interested in the genetics of their employees. According to the paper, in 2002, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway Company was charged for secretly testing employees to check for “carpal tunnel syndrome.” Stringent privacy policies, once again, must be established.
<p>…
<p>Will the HGP benefit everyone? It is open to discussion. The advancement of genetic technologies makes medicine and genetics more personalised than ever, but “personalised” items often benefit small groups of people who can afford them. But genetics can also be applied to benefit a large population—efficient HIV treatments, faster development of vaccines, to name a few. Certainly, the Human Genome Project created yet another playground on which people can build anything they want. Philosophical and ethical thoughts are the community guidelines.
<hr />
<h1 id="moving-onward">Moving Onward</h1>
<p>Perhaps, there is one group of people who are already disadvantaged. As mentioned before, they are the patients with rare diseases. The majority of such diseases are at least partially related to genetic factors, and debilitating symptoms prevent many from receiving proper education and securing a stable income.
<p>I found that this is a conceptually difficult research paper. Instead of clear-cut mathematics or descriptions of phenomena, there are a lot of debatable concepts with traditional terms related to philosophy and ethics. Summarizing complex ideas into short and simple sentences was hard. My mind sometimes went into a black hole, having to rewind ten stops.
<p>In the next article, I want to dive deep into this topic.
