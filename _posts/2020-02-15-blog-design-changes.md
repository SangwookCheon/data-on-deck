First, I want to change the way each article appears on the homepage. For pagination, I want each article's title to have a black thin frame around it, as if it is enclosed in a comic box. Instead of using a picture and color masking, I want to create a uniform appearance. So, the general theme is Black and White - like a traditional newspaper.

Second, I want to make each article shown in the homepage display description under the title, not the whole article (with fading). Maybe fading is cool, so I will keep that.

Third, I want to diversify the fonts used in the blog. For example, I want to change the font for the title. Font for the article looks fine. I want headers to have the same font as title.

Fourth, I want to change the link style for title of articles.

Fifth, on the "Light" page, I want to showcase one thing at the top, like a drawing, interactive, p5.js project, etc.
