A team of four musicians, including me, created a jazz version of Mr.Blue Sky, composed by the legendary Electric Light Orchestra.

We spent over a month recording ourselves at home and compiling videos! It was so much fun for me to sync the videos on Adobe Premier Pro and add more parts as necessary.

The project was finished on May 20th, and the video was showcased in our school's last assembly of the year.

Please enjoy!
