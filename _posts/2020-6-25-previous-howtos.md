Before starting this blog, I made some Kaggle kernels related to Python and Machine Learning. Starting from now, I will post How To Guides as articles for better accessibility. Nontheless, check to see if anything is useful to you!

# Keras Library
This is the number-one tool for efficient machine learning in Python, and it is my favorite.

* [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Keras](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/convolutional-neural-networks-cnn-keras)
* [Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/artificial-neural-networks-ann-keras)
* [Sample Digit Recognizer using Keras](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/digit-recognizer-keras-ml)

# Scikit Learn Library
This Python library has some similar functionalities to Keras, but it has other useful tools outside the scope of machine learning, such as clustering.

* [Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/regression-techniques-using-scikit-learn)
* [Classification Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/classification-techniques-using-scikit-learn)
* [Clustering Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/clustering-techniques-using-scikit-learn)
* [Association Rule Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/association-rule-learning-with-scikit-learn)
* [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/reinforcement-learning-using-scikit-learn)
* [Natural Language Processing (NLP) Basics](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/natural-language-processing-nlt-step-by-step)
* [Dimensionality Reduction Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/dimensionality-reduction-techniques-scikit-learn)
* [Model Selection and Boosting](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/model-selection-and-boosting-scikit-learn)

# Pandas Library
Pandas is essential for preparing data, which is the most important step for any kind of data science project.

I am sorry that these do not have much friendly explanation. For future articles, I will make sure they are as understandable as possible. The focus of last few years was just learning and learning, and I am excited to help readers along the away from now on!
