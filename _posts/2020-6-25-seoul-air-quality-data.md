I created a Kaggle kernel on how to clean up and prepare a dataset about Seoul's Air Qualit, which includes daily, monthly, and yearly records of pollutants, as well as businesses that emit pollutants.

Please check it [out with this link](https://www.kaggle.com/sangwookchn/seoul-s-air-quality-data-language-processing).

In the next article, I will show ways of analyzing the data, mostly graphs at this point.
