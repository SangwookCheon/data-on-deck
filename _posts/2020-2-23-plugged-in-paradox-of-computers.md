"I have a little announcement," I said.

It was a regular lunch meeting for my
service club. I pulled out my MacBook,
walked to the podium—an English
classroom is our venue—and began
talking.

"I am happy you had fun in AlHurriyah! If you couldn't go, we all can
revisit the school sometime. Sixty fifthgraders greeted us, and we checked if
there is a vacant room for computers."

<!–-break-–>

"Sixty?" Some gasped in unison.

"Exactly. We can teach more than
sixty, or even the whole school.
Sugata Mitra's 'Hole in the Wall'
experiment proved the power of a
single computer."

"But I want to share another story.
Last week, there was a three-hour trip
to a hilly village in Sentul. One girl I
met is re-reading her old comic books
because school is too far away."

Our advisor raised his eyebrows. I
took a breath and continued.

"Here's the dilemma: five computers
for ten out-of-school children in the
village or five-hundred students in AlHurriyah. What's better?"


Silence.


"Managing computers located threehours away would be hard, though."
one member commented.

"Definitely. But here's a plan called
'Computer Drive.' Like a delivery
service…" I spoke for another ten
minutes, but I knew I lost the
audience.

The dilemma, in fact, left me clueless
for days. After researching and
thinking, I passionately supported the
school-less children. Although it didn't
pass, it was a profound battle between
many and few, far and near, and
ultimately, my values and experiences
of others.

Is this dilemma ever answerable?
